I look at a lot of boomers who eventually take separate bedrooms, like my parents do. And it hurts my heart. üíî

Yet at the same time. I do believe the shared bedroom concept for couples takes away from their individuality.

I envision a world where we all have our own unique spaces. üåü

When I was in college my girlfriends parents insisted she have her own space. We thought it a waste of money at first, but the memories of that place will always hold a special place in my heart. It's decor was purely her. 

I understand now why your father was adamant about that. 

I often wish to be there. 

And when we graduated and moved back home for several months while we tried to decide what we would do with our lives next. I had my room in the basement, the same as I had as a teenager, only now it was packed wall to ceiling with my things. It gave me the happiness of my childhood. 

And I believe out of that, when we spent those 9 months not spending the night together. Me in my teenage bedroom and her in hers. Came something special. Because I know now we had been on the verge of breakup. 

Yet she would come home from work to see me and spend time in there with me. üò¢

That was beautiful. üåü

And I think that's how we began to create art together. I think that's how it should be done. 

Because while without that unique space we lose our individuality and independence. Eventually growing a resentment for each other's dependence. 

Those spaces don't necessarily need to be in different buildings, but they need to exist. Everyone needs a space just their own where they can escape and depcompress. A space where they can express their uniqueness, Or else that personality that we fell in love with in our partner will just fade out of existence,  

Every so often in relationships, for whatever reason things can become toxic and we must have the presence of mind to know when to step back and go to our respective spaces. And when they are uniquely ours they are the most comfortable. It is here where we are able to think clearly enough to find ourselves and remember why we miss our partner. 

And when our energies are in alignment || our respective spaces become a place of comfort where we can entangle elements of eachother that are good and positive; and hopefully purge rhe negative ‚ô•Ô∏è

I wrote this in response to a co-star informing me that my girlfriend from all those years ago was looking for the happiness she felt as a child and that I was on a quest for knowledge. üå†

My meditation on the entirety of my adult life produced these words and I give them to the world hoping they might the answer to the question of how to find the happiness of one's childhood as an adult.

Not many people are fortunate enough to get to spend time with their first true love a second time, especially not those of us who are married. I consider myself one of the luckiest people alive.
